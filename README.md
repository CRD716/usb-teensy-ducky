# usb-teensy-ducky
USB rubber ducky that gives you an administrator command prompt and automatically executes commands, but made on a default teensy 4.1. (Probably works with any teensy that has SD support)

Create a commands.txt file on your SD card, each next command seperated by a ;. This can be changed in the code.

## Note
development is currently halted due to being busy, i've made this public so that i'll eventually be forced to finish it. (no, it doesn't work (sorta) right now.)
